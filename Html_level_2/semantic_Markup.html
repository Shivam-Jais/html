<!--semantic markup
  it is the markup thar relates to the meaning of contenr
there are two types 
semantic - jisko dekha kr hei pata chal jay iske ander kis type ka content hoga eg header tag it means it will containt those element which will shows in top of the page

non semantic jisko dekha kr pata nah chale ander kis type ka content likha geya hai like div there can be multiple div it diffuclut to find out appropriate content

it provied meaning and layout structure 
seo friendly (search engine optimzation)kn se webste uper dikhane hai kn se nicha it knows by only through seo . 
usually google search semantic tag and usko pata chalta hai main contain ky honewala hai
is will improve rankng wish if it have good semantic 
readable + screen reader (user exprience improve )


header tag 
main tag
footer tag
nav tag its just like linking to another page 
artical tag 
section tag to group together related content 
aside tag related links or related content eg i search the avengers its show tony stark and it also show another movies is done by tony stark.it was unrealate avengers movie but it shows

by defalut we can make only one header , one main , one footer if we want then we can create by its not correct or ethic+-->
