        - Hr Tag in HTML  =  (the thematic Break (Horizontal Rule) element )  the <hr> html element represents a thematic break between paragraph - level element : for example a change of scence in a story or a shift of topic within a section.
        - HTML Entities an HTML   =  entity  is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand (&)and ends with a semicolon(;)
        HTML entities are frequently used to display reserved character (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTMl code) and invisible characters (like non - breaking spaces ).
        you can also use html character entites in place of other characters that are difficult to type with a standard keyboard
        For example, the entity for the copyright symbol (©) is &copy;. For less memorable characters, such as &#8212; or &#x2014;, you can use a reference chart or decoder tool. -->

        <!--example for hr element -->
